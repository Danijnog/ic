substances into the brain. A 2016 study in the Journal of 
Microencapsulation, titled Polysorbate-80-coated, polymeric curcumin 
nanoparticles for in vivo anti-depressant activity across BBB and 
envisaged biomolecular mechanism of action through a proposed 
pharmacophore model, successfully tests the transport of curcumin to 
affect an anti-inflammatory action in the brain.","2022-12-19 11:37:31","1893272097","2022-12-19","11:37:31"

"5210","Fully vaccinated children are significantly more 
likely to require emergency care than undervaccinated 
children. 
‚ÄúChildren who were under-vaccinated because of parental choice 
had significantly lower utilization rates of the emergency department 
and outpatient settings ‚Äî both overall and for specific acute illnesses ‚Äî 
than children who were vaccinated on time.‚Äù 
Glanz JM, Newcomer SR, et al. A population-based cohort study of 
undervaccination in 8 managed care organizations across the United 
States. JAMA Pediatr 2013 Mar 1; 167(3): 274-81. 
This study analyzed 323,247 healthcare records to compare children 
under 2 years of age who were fully vaccinated at CDC-recommended 
ages to children who were under-vaccinated (they did not receive all 
vaccines according to the recommended schedule). 
Children who were under-vaccinated the most had the greatest 
reductions in outpatient visits and healthcare utilization for upper 
respiratory illness, fever and pharyngitis when compared to on-time, 
fully vaccinated children (36% to 38% reductions). 
Children who were under-vaccinated because of parental choice had 
lower inpatient admission rates and significantly lower rates of 
outpatient and emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 
0.94 and 0.91, respectively) compared to on-time, fully vaccinated 
children. 
Nearly half of the children in this study were under-vaccinated ‚Äî a 
growing trend. 
About 13% of the children were under-vaccinated due to parental 
choice. 
All inpatient and emergency department visits between birth and 8 days 
of age were excluded from analysis although a hepatitis B vaccine is 
given to on-time, fully vaccinated children at birth.","2022-12-19 04:08:57","1893272097","2022-12-19","04:08:57"
"5211","The Committee repeatedly heard from government officials 
that merely exceeding the guideline was not cause for 
concern. One Merck official, in teaching a Grand Rounds 
session to staff in November of 1999, postulated that the 
minimum risk level would need to be multiplied by ten to 
reach a level at which harm would be expected through 
exposure. Dr. Roberta McKee of Merck wrote: 
``A number of environmental and public health agencies have 
set a Minimum Risk Level (MRL) for toxic substances. An MRL 
for ingestion is conceptually equivalent to the Reference 
Dose of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Acceptable Daily Intake of the US FDA, and the Tolerable 
Daily Intake of the WHO. Any exposure to the substance below 
the MRL is assured to be safe, while exposure to ten times 
the MRL is assumed to place one at risk of overdose. Exposure 
at or near the MRL is assumed to be safe but should trigger 
deliberate and careful review.'' 
Based on Dr. McKee's explanation, many babies were exposed 
to levels of mercury that ``placed one at risk of overdose,'' 
and were exposed to amounts well over ten times the EPA's 
scientifically validated reference dose. For example, at a 
recent Committee hearing, Chairman Dan Burton (R-IN) 
discussed his own family's experience with vaccine injuries: 
``My grandson received vaccines for nine different diseases 
in one day. He may have been exposed to 62.5 micrograms of 
mercury in one day through his vaccines. According to his 
weight, the maximum safe level of mercury he should have been 
exposed to in one day is 1.5 micrograms, so that is 41 times 
the amount at which harm can be caused.'' 
According to the analysis of Dr. McKee, based on the 
methylmercury ingestion guidelines, the Chairman's grandson 
would have exceeded the ``ten times the MRL'' and therefore was placed 
``at risk of overdose.'' In fact, with a 62.5 microgram 
exposure alone, the EPA, ATSDR, and FDA levels would have 
been exceeded by 10 times. Because the FDA chose not to 
recall thimerosal-containing vaccines in 1999, in addition to 
all of those already injured, 8,000 children a day continued 
to be placed ``at risk for overdose'' for at least an 
additional two years. 
It should also be noted that none of the Federal guidelines 
on mercury exposure have been included specific provisions 
for safe exposure limits for infants and children. It is 
widely accepted that infants and young children would be five 
times more sensitive to the toxic effect of mercury or other 
neurotoxins than adults. ``Exposures early in life are 
reasonably of greater health concern . . . because of greater 
brain organ susceptibility.'' The FDA has conceded in recent years that many children 
received doses of ethylmercury through their vaccinations 
that exceeded the EPA's minimal risk level for methylmercury. 
However, it is also clear that many infants received doses of 
ethylmercury that exceeded the FDA's higher threshold.","2022-12-19 05:23:36","1893272097","2022-12-19","05:23:36"

"5218","The Zionists deliberately suckered our women into lowering their birth rates to accelerate our genocide! So, the Zionists decided to use their tactic of ‚ÄïDivide and Conquer‚Äñ in order to break us apart and make us less effective. They played White nation against White nation or Britain against Germany; and again approximately twenty years later, they used the same ""divide and conquer"" strategy, playing the women against their husbands. The Zionists engaged in a propaganda campaign never before seen in the history of mankind. Through their Zionist controlled media, they set about to indoctrinate the White women of the world that their husbands (who loved them), were holding them down by trying to keep them pregnant at home and trapped in the kitchen all day long.","2022-12-19 17:42:41","1893272097","2022-12-19","17:42:41"
"5219","üëÜüëÜüëÜ Unfortunately, the Jewish Zionists were successful in their endeavor, at which time they accelerated their radical ‚ÄïFeminist Movement. So, what I am trying to get you to realize is that women were played for fools by the Jews, who didn‚Äòt give a damn about ‚Äïwomen‚Äòs rights. All the Zionists intended to do was to break up the healthy family unit, so that we GENTILE people would suffer a massive reduction in offspring; and the Zionist plan of GENTILE genocide would be one step closer to completion. Being a wonderful mother who stays home to raise her children properly is a worthy & noble occupation. If women‚Äòs role wasn‚Äòt extremely important, then the Zionist Jews wouldn‚Äòt be wasting their time trying to destroy the women‚Äòs natural instincts to pro-create. If women choose to not have multiple children, then the Zionists (who laugh at us for being so easily discouraged) will be ever so much closer to their final objective of wiping the GENTILE race from the face of the earth! So, every time you see a Zionist media creation portraying motherhood as an insignificant occupation, remember just how essential your role and contributions are to the future existence of the GENTILE Race of people, who happen to be the light that shines upon the world; which enriches all nations. In the future, when our people gain control of our country again and reclaim our rightful destiny, a compensation program will be established that will reward and recognize women who are mothers of multiple children. But of course that can‚Äòt occur until we prose-cute and deport all the Zionist criminals, who are intentionally destroying our countries and our potential ability to produce future offspring. So, let‚Äòs make a determined effort to resist the Zionists maniacal plot of permanent White & Gentile genocide by doing all that we can to encourage all Gentile women to seriously consider the future likelihood of raising a large White & Gentile family.","2022-12-19 17:42:41","1893272097","2022-12-19","17:42:41"
