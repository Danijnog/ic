"15558","My 27 year old son, my baby, got 2 phi pieces of bacon. First was bells palsy.  One whole half of his face was paralyzed.  Took him to ER. First question in triage. Have you had bacon. Dr. Looked me in the eye and told me it wasn't a side effect of bacon. Liar! Next came the baseball size cyst on his back. Had to be drained twice. Next was the blood in the urine. Visible red blood turned the toilet water red. Could find no cause for it. Then a rash on his neck that doesn't go away. Now for the last 3 months every Monday he gets nauseous and throws up and has diarrhea.

My mom (in her 60s) took both cookies and ended up bed-ridden! Her symptoms started a few months after her second. She was dizzy for months…stayed in bed with her eyes closed, crying. She didn’t have any energy or appetite and wanted to die! Doctors couldn’t figure it out. We had to help her shower, eat, take her to the toilet. Now, after months she started walking with a walker. She still can’t do much other than sit or walk with the walker. We’re thankful she is still alive. 
Weird thing is …I had a dream months earlier about all this. In my dream I’m told to tell her not to eat the cookies. She does anyways cause the media’s influence was stronger than mine. Im saddened that everyone I know ate them cookies.

He was as many a strong man who did have medical problems but fought them daily. Unfortunately on one occasion when returning from hospital cleared to return home. He did not make it. Why? Well a number of factors. 1. He was made to wear a mask in the ambulance which gave him breathing problems. He had to wear a breathing mask at night due to irregular breathing. He never made it home instead collapsing outside his home after leaving the ambulance. Once he had died I was contacted by hospital staff including a ward doctor and the A&E doctor shocked at why he had ""suddenly died"". They wanted to investigate further as they could not understand the reasons why. They even told me the day he was leaving hospital that he was in great spirits and looked great even taking time to go downstairs and buy the ward staff gifts. I explained to the doctors my suspicions and they agreed and wanted to investigate. I had to regretfully decline as my fathers wishes where to be buried in the Muslim way which would mean he would have to be buried in 3 days. I will never forgive or forget and to this day I know in my heart and soul that the prick was a massive factor in his demise.

The eight-year-old was then rushed to Bradford Royal Infirmary but could not be saved, leaving his family and friends devastated.

In just this past week, my ear ringing (that was almost 24/7) has only happened a couple of times, and it was very minor and after laying down for bed. My head was almost always feeling very heavy, lots of pressure and that had been for the last couple of months. The heaviness/bad pressure feeling is GONE! I have been feeling sleepy, but before I was feeling tired, majorly ran down and just BLAH, so feeling “just sleepy” is a HUGE improvement already. I know it’s a combo of the fact I had been lacking sleep for months, and the fact the necklace is causing those negative effects to be gone so, my body is just so relieved and wants to rest and be refreshed. My son is sleeping better and seems to be feeling better? It’s hard to tell because he does have autism but just him falling asleep so much faster, practically as soon as he lays down, is a major improvement for him!

Nyabuto, 23, a healthcare worker from Kenya, made headlines when her August 18 drowning death was captured on a Facebook livestream.

Known as “Hellen Wendy” on social media, Nyabuto filmed herself smiling and chatting with viewers in the shallow end of the pool before wandering into deeper waters. After moving outside the camera frame, she struggled and called for help for several minutes before the video went silent.

The livestream, which has since been removed from Facebook, captured two motel-goers entering the pool area several hours later.

"15629","My 27 year old son, my baby, got 2 phi pieces of bacon. First was bells palsy.  One whole half of his face was paralyzed.  Took him to ER. First question in triage. Have you had bacon. Dr. Looked me in the eye and told me it wasn't a side effect of bacon. Liar! Next came the baseball size cyst on his back. Had to be drained twice. Next was the blood in the urine. Visible red blood turned the toilet water red. Could find no cause for it. Then a rash on his neck that doesn't go away. Now for the last 3 months every Monday he gets nauseous and throws up and has diarrhea.
