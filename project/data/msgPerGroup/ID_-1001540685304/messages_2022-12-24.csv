"5246","INFANT VACCINATION. It is known that infants and children succumb 
to more infectious diseases than other groups. The reason is that newborns 
only fully develop their immune system when they’re 3 to 5 years old. The 
antibodies infants require to ward off diseases are passed to them from the 
mother through the placenta. The amount and type of antibodies the infant 
receives from the mother depends on the health of the mother herself, and 
the antibodies in her own immune system. At roughly 6 months old, the 
infant is capable of producing its own antibodies. However, again, a 
child’s immune system is only fully developed when it is 3 to 5 years of 
age. 
The theory of vaccination is to trigger and train the immune system. 
However, if the infant lacks a fully developed immune system until it’s 3 
to 5 years old, then vaccination is useless. Yet, babies are being vaccinated 
immediately after birth. As of 2018, the US has the highest infant 
vaccination rate, and it also happens to have the highest infant mortality 
rate among developed countries. 
""Vaccination at its core is neither a safe nor an effective method of disease 
prevention...If an infant needs one vaccine that is 100% safe and effective 
—that would be breast milk."" —Dr. Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD, 
immunologist, Harvard graduate 
If vaccines cause a long list of diseases, how is it possible that they can 
prevent disease? By virtue of their antigen-antibody theory, vaccines 
cannot prevent disease. They never have and never will. Nor can there be a 
“safe’ vaccine. It is only through clever advertising, marketing, and bribery that the drug companies have convinced the public that vaccines 
prevent diseases and save lives. 
In 2017, the drug companies spent $200 million bribing politicians, $6.4 
billion on advertising, and $10 billion indirectly bribing doctors. Since 
1796, doctors and scientists have called vaccines useless, worthless, 
poisonous, dangerous; a fraud, racket, and scam. And for good reasons. 
“Vaccination is a theory without any basis in fact.” —J.T. Biggs, JP, 
sanitation engineer, “Leicester: Vaccination versus Vaccination”, 1912 
Medical students thoroughly study books on germ, bacteria, pathogen, 
microbe, and vaccination theories. Only to have their worldview shattered 
when they’re introduced to parents whose children have been injured and 
killed by vaccines. The lesson with vaccination science is that results 
observed in laboratories and under microscopes cannot be duplicated in 
the real world. The human body is indemonstrably complex due to 
individual biochemistry. 
“In our scientific research we have now advanced one step. Vaccination is 
the infliction of disease…We conclude, then, that Vaccination is NOT 
scientific; that it cannot be accurately defined; that it is completely useless 
for its assumed purpose; that fortification of the body by disease is a 
mischievous myth, and that the sooner the practice is discontinued the 
better it will be for the health of the community.” —George S. Gibbs, 
Fellow of the Statistical Society London, “Is Vaccination Scientific?”,

"5240","PIP: A priest, president of Human Life International (HLI) based in Maryland, has asked Congress to investigate reports of women in some developing countries unknowingly receiving a tetanus vaccine laced with the anti-fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If it is true, he wants Congress to publicly condemn the mass vaccinations and to cut off funding to UN agencies and other involved organizations. The natural hormone hCG is needed to maintain pregnancy. The hormone would produce antibodies against hCG to prevent pregnancy. In the fall of 1994, the Pro Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign because they excluded all males and children and called for multiple injections of the vaccine in only women of reproductive age. Yet, one injection provides protection for at least 10 years. The Committee had vials of the tetanus vaccine analyzed for hCG. It informed HLI about the tetanus toxoid vaccine. HLI then told its World Council members and HLI affiliates in more than 60 countries. Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities. The priest objects that, if indeed the purpose of the mass vaccinations is to prevent pregnancies, women are uninformed, unsuspecting, and unconsenting victims.
