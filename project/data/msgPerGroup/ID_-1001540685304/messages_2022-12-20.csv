"5222","Vaccine administration is the second leading cause of febrile seizures (FS). FS occurrence in 
children is a serious concern because it leads to public apprehension of vaccinations. This review 
discusses the clinical implications of FS, its potential link to vaccinations and its impact on official 
recommendations for vaccinations in children. Vaccines such as the pertussis antigen-containing 
vaccine, the measles-containing vaccine and the influenza vaccine have been linked to FS. 
However, FS events are very rare and are not usually associated with downstream complications 
or severe neurologic diseases. Considering their significant health benefits, vaccinations have 
not been restricted in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, vaccine-induced FS could be a 
problem, particularly in genetically predisposed children. Therefore, post-marketing surveillance 
studies are required to accurately assess the incidence of FS and identify individuals who are 
particularly susceptible to FS after vaccination......     FULL DOCUMENT LINK: https://t.me/oneninetyfivenationsrising/3680","2022-12-20 07:42:40","1893272097","2022-12-20","07:42:40"
"5223","Inflammatory processes and immune dysfunction associated 
with autism [49,54,62] can result following exposure to many toxic 
metals including lead and mercury [54,63,64]. However, one of the 
most common metals towhich children are exposed regularly throughout 
the world is Al from vaccines [17,28,30,31]. This is especially 
true following the removal of mercury from most vaccines used in the 
developed world [64]. As mentioned, in our previous research we 
observed a positive and statistically significant correlation between Al 
adjuvant exposures (as well as the overall uptake of Al-adjuvanted 
vaccines), and ASD prevalence [28]. While ours was, to the best of our 
knowledge, the first study to investigate the possible association 
between Al vaccine adjuvants and ASD, at least three other studies 
have found a positive association between the prevalence of autism 
(and developmental disabilities) and vaccination uptake in early childhood, 
a result consistent with our findings [65,66]. In addition, Seneff 
et al. [30] recently reported results from their analyses of the VAERS 
database which strongly suggest that the Al in vaccines is toxic to 
vulnerable children and is likely implicated in autism. 
Furthermore, Melendez et al. [31] have recently confirmed that Al 
is a likely environmental risk factor for the development of ASD and 
behavioural impairments. Specifically, they showed that some metals 
such as chromium, arsenic and particularly Al were elevated in the 
blood of autistic children (n = 38) when compared to reference values 
of a normal child. In their study the authors identified two important 
data regarding exposure to toxic metals. Notably, in 80% of cases the 
autistic children have used controlled drugs and 90% of them have 
taken all vaccines. In addition, 70% of mothers took vaccines and 80% of 
them ate canned food and fish during pregnancy. Hence the results by 
Melendez et al. [31] suggest that cumulative exposure to Al from dietary 
and pharmaceutical sources (i.e., Al-containing drugs and vaccines) in 
early periods of developmental vulnerability (both pre- and postnatal) 
contributes to the development of ASD. Their findings are thus consistent 
with our hypothesis that Al is another environmental agent that can now 
be added to the list of xenobiotics associated with developmental 
immunotoxicity (as defined by Dietert and Dietert [54]) and thus an 
important and yet underappreciated risk factors in ASD..... FULL DOCUMANT LINK: https://t.me/oneninetyfivenationsrising/3677","2022-12-20 08:27:06","1893272097","2022-12-20","08:27:06"

"5226","Carroll Quigley, one of the original Black Listed A Listers, Weapons Systems and Political Stability, cites the difference between amateur weapons and specialist weapons in political structures.
Amateur weapons can be bought with an average person's one year savings and can be mastered by a single person within weeks, guns, swords, shields.
Specialist weapons can be bought by city or nation states and take several people months to master, submarines, satellites, catapults.

Amateur weapons liberate and specialist weapons dominate.
When amateur weapons prevailed as in Classical Antiquity and also in the 1800s, freedom reigned. The rest of history, the world is besought by tyranny.

I apply this difference of amateur liberation and specialist domination across technology with the addition of expert technology, technology that creates, technology that the wielder builds from scratch, yo-yo, boomerang, bow and arrow, light saber, to give examples of expert weapons technologies.

There's a battle of experts right now, to make literacy specialist or amateur. The west liberates with amateur literacy and the east dominates with specialist literacy. My comics work is in part, to help amateurs gain literacy, but also to give expertise to the reader.

Anyway, the stock market of the roaring twenties was all amateur.
By the time our parents and grandparents got in, it became specialist technology. It was created by experts however.

Amateurs are making money in cryptocurrency right now but only for so much longer. The biggest push in cryptocurrency, like in my comics, is for people to gain their own expertise. Coinbase offers amateur technology but also caters to the specialist. The people who can still build and defend their own computers rule crypto.

Now I'm adding more to my third dimension of politicalcompass.org, centralization

Globalism
Colonialism
Imperialism
Nationalism
Federalism
Citizenship
Populism
Bigotry
Idiocy

I note that federalism is still center but populism is pushed more ether depth of this third dimension.

Thanks for lending an ear.","2022-12-20 18:52:21","1552113836","2022-12-20","18:52:21"
