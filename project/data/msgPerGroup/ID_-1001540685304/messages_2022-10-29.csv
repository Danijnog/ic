Inflation rate dropping is still inflation, but inflation rate inflating (rising) is hyperinflation. We've only seen the beginning of the planned hyperinflation.
Major current causes of US$ price inflation
‚Ä¢Increased money ($) supply (supply/demand)
‚Ä¢Illegal War (reduced demand)
‚Ä¢Yuan Soros's pick for global reserve currency (reduced demand)

There were only $3T in the 1980s when gold was $800. Now there are $31T. Improvements in technology have brought down gold but we've only begun to see inflation from the latest increase from $24T supply in 2016 and STILL seeing inflation from the 100% increase in 2016 from $12T in 2008. All that is Fiat Debt to The Fed, not asset backed like gold or tokenized assets, and our taxes pay only the interest on that debt.

The Yuan is still only the 4th most traded currency around the globe. George Soros announced China to host the New World Order global currency in 2014. Agenda 21, bear in mind, is a plan for the next hundred years. George Soros said it on video eight years ago but Alex Jones, among other gonzo journalists, reported it from UN documents easily ten and fifteen years before that.","2022-10-29 01:32:29","1552113836","2022-10-29","01:32:29"
