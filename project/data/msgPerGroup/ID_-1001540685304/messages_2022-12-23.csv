"5238","These Swiss Octogone Yaldabaoth creeps look mighty stupid up there with the Geneva convention when the whole point is that we don't do it to them so that they don't do it to us. Yaldabaoth is a segmented organism and convulses in orgasm reflex like any other worm. For them to attack at the biological corner in such abstrusely cruel and grotesquely arthritic pageantry begs no mercy in return. A parasite feigns weak powerlessness, usuals a beggar for mercy and not the opposite. Whether humanity survives or not, this organism is liable to extinguish its own species and any who ally with it.","2022-12-23 20:51:12","1552113836","2022-12-23","20:51:12"
