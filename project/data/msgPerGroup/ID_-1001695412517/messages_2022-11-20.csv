➡️ Mr. Biden dichiara, ""Vi proteggeremo dai Russi""
➡️ Mr. Putin dichiara, ""Vi proteggeremo dagli Americani""

Rispondiamo ad una sola voce, ""Cari presidenti tenetevi pure la vostra fottuta guerra e la vostra fottuta protezione mafiosa, ci difendiamo benissimo da soli, voi soli siete i nostri veri nemici""

Non esistono guerre che si possano vincere
È una bugia a cui abbiamo smesso di credere

➡️ Mr. Biden says, ""We'll protect you from the Russians""
➡️ Mr. Putin says, ""We'll protect you from the Americans""

Let's answer with one voice, ""Dear presidents we don't need your fucking war and your fucking protection racket, we defend ourselves very well, you are our real enemies""

There is no such thing as a winnable war
It's a lie we don't believe anymore

"12244","On October 26, 1863, at a meeting of Freemasons at “ Freemason's Tavern, Queen Elizabeth No. 11 ”, in London, the rules of football were written down, thus forming the English Football Association.

At the meeting, serious disagreements arose among the participants. One sector, led by representatives of the “ Rugby League ”, was in favor of allowing the use of hands, but the group led by the “ League of Harrow ” leaned towards allowing only the use of the feet and head. Those in favor of allowing the use of hands withdrew from the meeting and laid the foundations of the sport they called “ Rugby ”.

Then, under the guidance of the Grand Master of Lodge No. 11, the rules of the game were determined. Football would be a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each and four referees so that the rules were met.

The grass field would be rectangular, natural or artificial, with an arch on each side of the field. The objective would be to move a ball with any part of the body other than the hands or arms, and especially with the feet, trying to enter the opponent's arc. This objective would be called “action”. The team that scored the most goals in 90 minutes would be the winner. Among the main promoters of the new sport were Freemasons chosen for this meeting at “Freemason Tavern, Queen Elizabeth No. 11”. The Freemasons who founded the foundations of football applied the spirit of equality and fraternity, without distinction of nationality, race, ideology, religion or sex. The bench is the “meeting point”, where admirers applaud or criticize the players, regardless of whether they are a socialist, capitalist, a social democrat, or a third world player.It should not be considered if the player comes from the lower classes or if he was born into a wealthy family.

The game has evolved in keeping with the Masonic spirit of its foundation; today it does not choose sex (from the women's world cup in China in 1991) and it does not discriminate, because there are world football championships organized by the “International Gay and Lesbian Football Association (IGLFA)” from 1992. Regardless of the outcome, players swapped shirts at the end of the match, an expression that emphasizes the value of tolerance, another Masonic principle.

Freemasonry took football to many countries by founding clubs and encouraging the sport. A great example of this Masonic influence can be seen in Argentina where football arrived through English travelers, many of whom were Freemasons. On June 20, 1867 the first game was played at the Buenos Aires Cricket Club. A group of partners led by brothers Thomas and James Hogg published an advertisement in the newspaper “The Standard” calling for a meeting to promote the practice of football. This group immediately founded the Buenos Aires Football Club, from the encounter between the reds and the whites, who won the first ones by 4 to 0, organized with these two colors to correspond to the attributes of the Master Mason. https://www.freemason.pt/a-maconaria-e-o-futebol/","2022-11-20 14:56:10","5638208965.0","2022-11-20","14:56:10"
