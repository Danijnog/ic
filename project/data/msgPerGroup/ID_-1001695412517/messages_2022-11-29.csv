"12408","The UN outlines a new campaign against “hate speech”

If you're tired of censorship, cancel culture, and the erosion of privacy and civil liberties subscribe to Reclaim The Net.
The United Nations (UN) is dishing out tips on social media to citizens around the world on how to “say no to hate” – specifically online, declaring at the same time that “words can be weapons” which lead to violence in real life.

Instead of dedicating all its energy to policing, through peacekeeping, warzones, and making sure international law and the UN Charter are respected by all its member-states, the UN seems to have plenty of time and resources to be policing online speech.

Related: UN is working with tech, media companies, and states to address “misinformation” and “hate speech”

There have been instances of violent incidents/protests resulting in violence committed by individuals who, like billions of others, had a presence on social media.","2022-11-29 23:27:42","5638208965.0","2022-11-29","23:27:42"
