"12028","Sou agricultor. Nasci, cresci e aprendi a terra e o alimento.
Fiz me engenheiro e procurei outras paragens e conhecimentos.
Estudei o ser Humano pela pena da estat√≠stica m√©dica e epidemiologia.
Dedico a carreira a ajudar, uma gota, o cuidar e curar pela m√£o de m√©dicos e enfermeiros.

O momento de maior orgulho at√© hoje foi partilhar um painel com Michael Levitt, ainda que virtualmente. 

Concretizei o agricultor que conversa de igual para um pr√©mio nobel.
este √© genial e subscrevo cada palavra de coragem. Levitt desde 2020 que escreve a ci√™ncia. Orgulho me partilhar a sua vis√£o e ter dito o mesmo, noutra l√≠ngua, noutras palavras.

Continuarei agricultor.

on Christianity, Biblical morals, the family, and the

"12013","Passovers of Blood by Ariel Toaff
This translation was performed free of charge to protest an injustice - the destruction by the ADL of Ariel Toaff's ""Blood Passover"" on Jewish ritual murder. The author is the son of the Chief Rabbi of Rome, and a professor of Jewish Renaissance and Medieval History at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, just outside Tel Aviv. Dr. Toaff is uniquely qualified to write this book, being thoroughly familiar with the derivative literature in English, French, German and Italian, as well as the original documentary sources in Latin, Medieval Italian, Hebrew and Yiddish. This is not something he worked on in secret. If it had been published in Israel, in Hebrew, no one would have cared. There are large bodies of literature in Hebrew that Jews do not wish Gentiles to know about. But Dr. Toaff's announcement of its publication in Italy, in Italian, raised a worldwide firestorm of fury. Under unbearable pressure, the book was withdrawn. As soon as the book was released, it drew immediate condemnation from scholars, various Jewish groups, and Israeli officials. The mere hint that Jews were involved in murder of Christians, even ones that occurred hundreds of years ago, was seen as very problematic and dangerous for the Jewish community. A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League stated that ‚ÄúExtremist, anti-Semitic, and Islamic extremist groups will undoubtedly use this charge to further their hostile aims to the Jewish people.‚Äù The outrage among some people led to Ariel Toaff receiving death threats and calls for him to be fired by his university.

""We've seen incidents where people have described them as explosive ‚Äî incidents where they actually have so much power, they're actually blowing walls down in between rooms and apartments."" As of Friday, the FDNY investigated 174 battery fires, putting 2022 on track to double the number of fires that occurred last year (104) and quadruple the number from 2020 (44).

"12048","Mouth cancer causes grow as cases skyrocket in UK, HPV now a major concern

Cases of mouth cancer in the UK have increased by more than one-third in the last decade to hit a record high, according to a new report. The number of cases has more than doubled within the last generation and previous common causes like smoking and drinking are being added to by other lifestyle factors. Comment: Except the number of people who smoke is at a record low, so clearly smoking isn't to blame. According to the Oral Health Foundation, 8,864 people in the UK were diagnosed with the disease last year - up 36 per cent on a decade ago, with 3,034 people losing their life to it within the year. This is an increase in deaths of 40 per cent in the last 10 years, and a 20-per-cent rise in the last five.
