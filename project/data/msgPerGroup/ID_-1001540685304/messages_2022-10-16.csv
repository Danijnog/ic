"4803","ABOUT DRUGS AND THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE: 
""If all the medicine in the world were thrown into the sea, it would be bad for the fish and good for humanity."" 0. W. Holmes, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Harvard University 
""Preventable drug-related morbidity and mortality represents a serious medical problem. Negative therapeutic outcomes resulting from drug therapy is estimated up to 138.8 billion dollars per year."" 
A.M.A. Archives of Internal Medicine 
""61% of all deformities in newborn infants and 88% of all stillbirths must be attributed to the effects of medication."" Dr. W. Mueller, First University Hospital For Women, Munich 
""We must educate the consumer about health care. We must shake people out of their mindless, brain-washed acceptance of the medical system and its dogmas."" Dr. Sidney Singer, The Medical Report 
""Drug medications consist in employing as remedies for disease, those things which produce disease in well persons. Its material medicine is simply a lot of drugs and chemicals and dye-stuffs, in a word, poisons. All are incompatible with vital matter, all with living matter, all produce disease when 
brought in contact with living matter, all are poisons.• 
R.T. Trail, M.D., Lecture to members of Congress and medical profession at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. 
''The greater part of all chronic disease is created by the suppression of acute disease by drug poisoning."" Harry Lindlahr, M.D. 
""Medical practice has neither philosophy nor common sense to recommend it. In sickness, the body is already loaded with impurities. By taking drug medicines more impurities are added thereby the case is further embarrassed and harder to cure."" Elmer Lee, M.D. Past Vice President, The Academy of Medicine 
""Medicine is only palliative, for lack of disease lies the cause, and this cause no drug can reach."" Wier Mitchel, M.D. 
""Don't trust your doctor. Assume that if he prescribes a drug, it's dangerous. There is no safe drug."" Robert C. Mendelsohn, M.D. ""Confession of a Medical Heretic"" 
""Any drug without toxic effects is not a drug at all."" 
Eli Lilly, head of Eli Lilly Drug Company 
""The entire field of orthodox oncology will disappear as chemotherapy, surgery and radiation for cancer are revealed as fundamentally irrational and scientifically unsupportable. The value of ultra-radical surgery, of routine postoperative irradiation and of adjuvant chemotherapy have been grossly 
exaggerated and oversold to the public. Often times, patients die from the operation, not the condition."" George Crile, M.D. ""Dissent in Medicine""","2022-10-16 22:52:02","1893272097","2022-10-16","22:52:02"
