"5282","[1/7, 8:26 PM] G—Wiz: If crypto rallied and all the coins went up big the inflation it would create would be phenomenal.
[1/7, 8:28 PM] Ned: Crypto is a response to inflation, not a direct cause. Crypto or not, people are getting out of the dollar, putting their savings into more stable value than hyperinflationary fiat.
[1/7, 8:30 PM] Ned: The demand for Fiat is shrinking and it's natural for crypto to fill that void. There have always been alternative and back up currencies. You know I did the NORFED thing fifteen years ago. We had Ithaca HOURS $10 each around that time. Post WWII Germany a wheelbarrow of paper Deutsch Marks would hardly buy a loaf of bread but cigarettes were good money.
[1/7, 9:12 PM] G—Wiz: Looks to me like the safe place will us tres notes bonds and Bill's. Or treasury tips or step ups. Treasury inflation protected securities  Tips.
[1/7, 9:13 PM] G—Wiz: Inflation will subside at some point.
[1/7, 9:20 PM] G—Wiz: I've been looking first for correction. We got one. Also a long recession 1 to 2 years.we will still have relative inflation because rates were at all time low. We are not going back there. But insane inflation like germany post ww2  that wont happen.
[1/7, 9:40 PM] Ned: Not before Shemitah 2030 or Shemita 2051, that's the UN Agenda 21 scheme. I forget the details but Agenda 2030 and Agenda 2050 are obviously if surreptitiously schemed around Shemita.
[1/7, 9:44 PM] Ned: WWIII is scheduled for 2025—2045 so probably shemitah 2051 but maybe they'll throw us off and ""pull it"" shemitah 2037 or Shemita 2044. I told you I was in Russia Shemita 1994 and experienced the crashing ruble first hand, if with a wallet full of $1 bills each worth progressively from 1400 rubles to 2,000 rubles within a span of only ten days.
[1/7, 10:24 PM] G—Wiz: At some point the market will get hit down below its previous low. Crypto will go down with it.
[1/8, 12:24 AM] Ned: Some shemita or other","2023-01-08 05:32:30","1552113836","2023-01-08","05:32:30"
