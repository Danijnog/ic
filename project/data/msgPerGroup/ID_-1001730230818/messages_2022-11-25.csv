"16202","I bought 3 of these and got them one week ago. In just this past week, my ear ringing (that was almost 24/7) has only happened a couple of times, and it was very minor and after laying down for bed. My head was almost always feeling very heavy, lots of pressure and that had been for the last couple of months. The heaviness/bad pressure feeling is GONE! I have been feeling sleepy, but before I was feeling tired, majorly ran down and just BLAH, so feeling “just sleepy” is a HUGE improvement already. I know it’s a combo of the fact I had been lacking sleep for months, and the fact the necklace is causing those negative effects to be gone so, my body is just so relieved and wants to rest and be refreshed. My son is sleeping better and seems to be feeling better? It’s hard to tell because he does have autism but just him falling asleep so much faster, practically as soon as he lays down, is a major improvement for him!

"16203","Studies Prove Cell Phone Radiation Causes Damage to DNA
The latest studies confirm that what the cellular phone corporations do not want you to know. Even casual use of a cell phone can cause damage to DNA in sensitive areas of the brain
A landmark study conducted by Dr. Henry Lai of the University of Washington showed that even at low levels, exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields and radio frequencies (EMF/RF) caused DNA damage to brain cells of rats, resulting in loss of short and long-term memory and slower learning. He further noted:
“DNA damages in cells could have an important implication on health because they are cumulative.” 1
A study done at Penn State University concluded that EMF exposure produced no effect for the “first few minutes, . . . then a cascade of microbial destruction occurs.”
