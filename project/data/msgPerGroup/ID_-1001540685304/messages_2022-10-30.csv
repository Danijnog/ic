William of Tyre on Byzantium & Manuel Komnenos - A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea

A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea

Manuel I Komnenos Byzantine EmperorWilliam of Tyre knew Manuel very well over a number of years.  He strayed with him for seven months in Constantinople before heading for western Europe.  Manuel spoke French (and probably Turkish) so here was no language barrier.  I don't know if William spoke Greek or not.  Some of his fellow Latin clerics in the Latin Kingdom did.  His history was written in Latin.

Manuel's second wife was a French princess from Antioch.  They had one son who was betrothed to the daughter of King Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who moved to Constantinople.  Louis and Eleanor had visited Constantinople and had been guests of Manuel.  Many of Manuel's best friends were ""Latins"".  There were a large number of them in Imperial service and fighting as mercenaries in the army.  I have gone through all of this book and have selected the most important parts related to Manuel to put here.  I have put lines between the sections.

The part related to the death of John II is very interesting.  It is believed that John was assassinated by his French mercenaries by poisoning  and this story is not truthful.  His father had intended for Manuel to become king of a new eastern kingdom he would create.  That's one reason Manuel learned French at a young age.  His father took him with him on all of his campaigns and introduced him to all of the rulers of cities and realms of the east they visited.  John's plans were ruined when Manuel's two other brothers died within a few days of each other.  The first, Alexios had been crowned co-emperor and was married to a Russian princess.  His younger brother, Andronikos, was also married to a Russian.  John and his wife, Eirene-Piroska, a Hungarian princess of French descent, had eight children.  After Alexios and Andronikos died John passed over the next son, Isaac and gave the throne to Manuel.  Isaac was a problem son for John.  He was not interested in the army and was an intellectual. I also think John felt he could not be trusted and lacked the values an emperor had to process to rule effectively.

William's account of the terrible defeat of Myrokhephalon in 1176 is very personal, it's obvious that he was in Manuel's inner circle and observed his reaction first-hand.

William was Archbishop of Tyre from 1175-84 and an official from 1174 until his death of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, He was born in the Crusader Kingdom in 1130 and died in 1186 when he was around 55 years of age. - Bob Atchison

About this time, Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, the worst persecutor of the Latins, was removed from the affairs of this world, He was succeeded by his son John. This emperor was much more humane than his father had been, and, as his worth deserved, was far more acceptable to our people. His attitude toward the Latins was not entirely sincere, however, as the following pages will show...

John II KomnenosMeanwhile numerous reports began to circulate through the land. It was rumored that John, emperor of Constantinople, son of Alexius, was about to descend swiftly upon Syria. From every part of his empire he had summoned people of all tribes and tongues, and now, with a countless number of cavalry and a vast array of chariots and four-wheeled carts, he was on the march. Nor was this mere empty rumor. As soon as he learned from reliable sources that the people of Antioch had summoned Raymond thither, that they had given the city to him, and had bestowed upon him as his wife the daughter of Lord Bohemond, John determined to go to Antioch.","2022-10-30 05:32:22","1552113836","2022-10-30","05:32:22"
