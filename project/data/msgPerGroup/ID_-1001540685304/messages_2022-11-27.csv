"5086","""The fact is that sooner or later, Andrew Wakefield will be exonerated, his theory will be accepted and a vaccine-autism connection will be proven. As the New Year comes around, Wakefield's research is being duplicated in prestigious centers in the United States. In addition, viral culture results are expected soon from the National Institutes of Health laboratories. ""--[letter BMJ 2005] F. Edward Yazbak, 
 
""This report describes six mothers  who received live virus vaccines and one who received a Hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy after having  received an MMR booster  five months prior to conception.   All the children who resulted from these pregnancies have had developmental problems,  six out seven (85%) were diagnosed with autism, and the seventh seems to exhibit symptoms often associated with  autistic spectrum disorders.""---F Yazbak MD 
 
Worried about vaccination being blamed for Regressive Autism, the health authorities and vaccine promoters quickly circulated the idea that autism, supposedly a purely “genetic disorder”, manifested itself between 18 and 24 months of age. In time, that somewhat preposterous idea became an accepted scientific fact, even though the syndrome was originally called “Infantile Autism” or “Kanner’s Infantile Autism” and an infant is, by definition, a child under the age of 12 months......So why don’t any of those little ones ever regress - really, really regress - at 11 months of age and why do they all wait and regress all together, just after their first birthday and their “one-year” check-up whether they are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt or Australia?  Why don’t we ever, ever hear of babies regressing into autism during the vaccine break period, between 6 and 12 months of age or more specifically between age 9 and 12 months, when they are doing all those wonderful exciting things we need to call the neighbors, friends and family to witness or quickly find the movie camera to record?

""As a clinician, my current belief which guides my practice with these children is that any child given the HepB vaccination at birth and subsequent boosters along with DPT has received unacceptable levels of neurotoxin in the form of the ethyl mercury in the thimerosal preservative used in the vaccine. In any child with a genetic immune susceptibility (probably about one in six) this sets off a series of events that injure the brain-gut-immune system. By the time they are ready to receive the MMR vaccination, their immune system is so impaired in a great number of these children that the triple vaccine cannot be handled by the now dysfunctional immune system and they begin their obvious descent into the autistic spectrum disorder.""---Jaquelyn McCandless, M.D","2022-11-27 13:48:14","1623367056","2022-11-27","13:48:14"

 The epidemic with autism really started during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it seemed to coincide with the time that the vaccines for Hib (Hemophilus influenzae type b) and hepatitis B were added to the vaccine schedule--Hib around 1988, hepatitis B in 1991. The children had already had the DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine through the 1980s, and the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) was subsequently added; but we did not realize much of an upswing until the hepatitis B vaccine was added at birth.

Several of the participants tried to imply that autism was a genetic disorder and therefore could have nothing to do with vaccines. Dr. Weil put that to rest with this comment, ""We don't see that kind of genetic change in 30 years."" In other words, how can we suddenly see a 300% increase in a genetically related disorder over such a short period? It is also known that there are two forms of autism, one that is apparent at birth and one that develops later in childhood. The former has not changed in incidence since statistics have been kept; the other is epidemic. THE TRUTH BEHIND THE VACCINE COVER-UP By Russell Blaylock, M.D. 
 
The medical literature is abound with studies on the deleterious effects of mercury on numerous enzymes, mitochondrial energy production, synaptic function, dendritic retraction, neurotubule dissolution and excitotoxicity, yet, he sees only a ""theoretical risk"" associated with an ever increasing addition of thimerosal-containing vaccines THE TRUTH BEHIND THE VACCINE COVER-UP By Russell Blaylock, M.D. 
 
  CDC officials claim vaccines are safe and effective. Is that true? If vaccines are safe, why did the incidence of autism increase from one case of autism in 10,000 American children to one case of autism in 150 American children after the massive childhood vaccination program began? If childhood vaccines are safe, why are 560,000 vaccinated children afflicted with autism while nonvaccinated Amish and Mennonite children rarely have the disease? Why has the incidence of asthma, allergies, autoimmune disease, Type I diabetes, and neurologic conditions dramatically increased in vaccinated children?  Why do obstetricians give pregnant women influenza vaccines that contain a toxic dose of mercury? Why do newborn children receive Hepatitis B vaccine in the nursery when there is no medical justification for the immunization?  Dr. Blaylock's discussion addresses those, and many other, issues.
