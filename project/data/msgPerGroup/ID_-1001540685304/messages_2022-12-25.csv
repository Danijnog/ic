"5250","The mercury amalgams in your mouth, the so-called silver 
fillings, contain 48 to 50 percent of elemental mercury. 
These fillings continuously emit mercury vapor, which will go 
to the brain and is converted to mercuric mercury . . . 
Certain fish contain methylmercury; again, very rapidly taken 
up from the GI tract, transported quickly to the brain, and 
converted very slowly to mercuric mercury . . . thimerosal, 
which again will be taken up by the brain and quickly 
converted to mercuric mercury--all three forms are neurotoxic. 
``By neurotoxic, we mean it will damage nerves and it will 
damage brain tissues. 
``Let me just say as a final statement that there is no 
need to have thimerosal in a vaccine.'' 
In making a presentation to the Institute of Medicine's 
Immunization Safety Review Committee, in July 2001, the 
former Director of the Environmental Toxicology Program at 
the National Institutes of Health, Dr. George Lucier, 
proffered the following conclusions: 
Ethylmercury is a neurotoxin. 
Infants may be more susceptible than adults. 
Ethylmercury should be considered equipotent to 
methylmercury as a developmental neurotoxin. This conclusion 
is clearly public health protective. 
Ethylmercury exposure from vaccines (added to dietary 
exposures to methylmercury) probably caused neurotoxic 
responses (likely subtle) in some children. 
While the debate over whether ethyl or methylmercury is 
more toxic will probably not be resolved in the near future, 
a consensus appears to be emerging that exposure to these 
different types of mercury cannot be considered in isolation. 
Rather, witnesses before the Committee stressed that in 
determining safe levels of mercury exposure, the cumulative 
level of exposure to all types of mercury must be considered. 
Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet made the following observation at the 
July 19, 2002 hearing: 
``More concerning to me in the Institute's treatment of 
mercury problems, was the almost complete absence of regard 
for compounding effect of thimerosal on preexisting mercury 
levels. The NHANES Study from the CDC had already established 
that perhaps one in ten children is born to mothers with 
elevated mercury burden.","2022-12-25 10:16:20","1893272097","2022-12-25","10:16:20"
