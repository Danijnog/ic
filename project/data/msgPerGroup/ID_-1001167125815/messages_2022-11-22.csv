The president of Bolsonaro's political party (PL), Valdemar da Costa Neto, has asked the Supreme Electoral Court to dismiss the results from the non auditable voting machines of the second round of our elections.

So this would give Bolsonaro an instant victory against against crooked Lula and The Foro de SÃ£o Paulo.

In my opinion, this is checkmate.

Even with Egghead quick answer, demanding Valdemar to show an audit of the first round also... I truly believe this is checkmate.

Egghead demands the audit of the first round of those same machines to be delivered tomorrow. This is impossible!

If they have already done it, they can deliver to the court. But I highly doubt it this is the case.

The Supreme Electoral Court has the last move before things go south.

They now have to discard the other ones, or give proof (the source code) that the voting machines are auditable.

Either way they lose.
