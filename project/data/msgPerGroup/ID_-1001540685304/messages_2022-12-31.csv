There are many controversies about vaccines and autism, 
especially since many parents cite normal development of 
their children until they receive vaccines at about the age of 
18 months (Lewine et al., 1999). The vaccine organism itself 
could be a culprit. For example, one hypothesis of the cause 
of autism is that the pertussis toxin in the DPT vaccine causes 
a separation of the G-alpha protein from retinoid receptors in 
genetically at-risk children (Farfel et al., 1999; Megson, 2000). 
The pertussis toxin creates a chronic autoimmune monocytic 
infiltration of the gut mucosa lamina propia and may disconnect 
the G-alpha protein pathways, leaving some G-alphamodulated 
pathways unopposed. In turn, the non-specific branch of the immune system is turned on and, without retinoid switching, cannot be down regulated. 
Another organism of suspect is the live measles virus. 
When the measles vaccine is given, it depletes the children of 
their existing supply of Vitamin A, which negatively impacts 
the retinoid receptors, accounting for the distorted vision in 
autistic individuals (Megson, 2000; Rosales, 2002). This could 
account for the fact that autistic subjects’ ability to see is not 
normal, with malfunctioning rods causing distortion of the 
peripheral vision. When the natural form (cis) of Vitamin 
A was given to autistic subjects for 2–3 months, followed 
by urocholine, many autistic children showed immediate 
improvement in their autistic behaviors, including improved 
eye contact, ability to socialize, ability to sleep through the 
night, etc. (Megson, 2000). 
Vaccine preservative 
There is evidence that Thimerosal (which is 49% ethyl mercury) 
is indeed harmful. Since the 1930s, Thimerosal has been 
extensively used as an antibacterial agent in vaccines (Geier 
et al., 2007). Thimerosal has been implicated as a cause of 
autism. Not only is every major symptom of autism documented 
in cases of mercury poisoning but also biological 
abnormalities in autism are very similar to the side effects of 
mercury poisoning itself (Bernard et al., 2001): these include 
psychiatric disturbances (e.g., impairments in sociality, stereotypic 
behaviors, depression, anxiety disorder, and neuroses), 
increased incidences of allergies and asthma, increases in 
the presence of IgG autoantibodies against brain and myelin 
basic proteins, reductions in natural killer cell function, and 
increases in neopterin levels (indicative of immune activation). 
Autistic brains show neurotransmitter irregularities 
that are virtually identical to those arising from mercury 
exposure, i.e., changes in serotonin and dopamine concentrations, 
elevated epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in 
the plasma and brain, elevated serum glutamate levels, and 
an acetylcholine deficiency in the hippocampus (Bernard 
et al., 2001). Due to the extensive parallels between autism 
and mercury poisoning, the likelihood of a causal relationship 
is great. More evidence linking autism with mercury poisoning is the timing of inclusion of Thimerosal in vaccines 
in the 1930s closely preceding the discovery of autism in 1943 
(Kanner, 1943).","2022-12-31 15:33:53","1893272097","2022-12-31","15:33:53"
