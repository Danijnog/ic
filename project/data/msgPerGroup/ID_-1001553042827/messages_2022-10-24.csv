"31810","Fauci & Friends Going Down! The 1st Dominoe Has Fallen

The significance of yesterday's ruling is indeed historic.

It's the first time any major case, alleging criminal activity in connection with the COVID response, has reached the deposition/discovery phase in our judicial system.

We've never needed a good attorney (even though we have a bunch)...we've needed a good judge.

The beginning of the end has begun for the criminals which is why they panicked imho and rushed to get the shots on the childhood schedule before this all comes crashing down after the election.

Read this by the judge...

""First, Plaintiffs assert that Dr. Fauci has refused to verify under oath his own interrogatory responses in violation of this Court’s Order. The NIAID’s responses were instead verified by Dr. Jill Harper, who was not named in the Complaint. Accordingly, Dr. Fauci has made no statements under oath regarding his communications with social-media platforms, which violates this Court’s Order regarding the discovery that instructed Dr. Fauci to provide interrogatory responses.21 The Court sees the importance of having Dr. Fauci make statements under oath as it relates to the issues of this matter.

Next, Plaintiffs argue that even if Dr. Fauci can prove he never communicated with social- media platforms about censorship, there are compelling reasons that suggest Dr. Fauci has acted through intermediaries, and acted on behalf of others, in procuring the social-media censorship of credible scientific opinions. Plaintiffs argue that even if Dr. Fauci acted indirectly or as an intermediary on behalf of others, it is still relevant to Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion. The Court agrees. ""

It's OVER!

This is the break we've known would eventually come...and now it's here.

Let the flood gates open!

”Să nu ne facem griji pentru cei care trag asupra Ungariei ascunşi în umbră, de undeva din turnurile de pază de la Bruxelles"", a declarat el într-un discurs rostit la Zalaegerszeg, cu ocazia sărbătorii naţionale de comemorare a revoltei din Ungaria împotriva URSS în 1956.

""Ei vor sfârşi acolo unde au sfârşit şi predecesorii lor"", a adăugat Orban, prezicând Uniunii Europene o soartă similară cu cea a Uniunii Sovietice.","2022-10-24 05:26:09","1475016483","2022-10-24","05:26:09"
