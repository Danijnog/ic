"5278","Cell lines originating from aborted babies 
There are two particular fetal cell lines that are heavily used in vaccine production. They are named according to the laboratory facilities where they were developed. One cell line is known as WI-38, developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, PA. The other is MRC-5, developed for the Medical Research Council in England. WI-38 was developed by Dr. Leonard Hayflick in 1962, by taking lung cells from an aborted female baby at approximately the end of the third month of pregnancy. Dr. Hayflick’s article published in the journal Experimental Cell Research states that WI-38 (and other cell lines) was developed from an aborted baby: “All embryos were obtained from surgical abortions and were of approximately three months’ gestation.”(1) Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed a Rubella vaccine using WI-38, addressed a question at an international conference as to the origin of WI-38. Dr. Plotkin stated: 
 
“This fetus was chosen by Dr. Sven Gard, specifically for this purpose. Both parents are known, and unfortunately for the story, they are married to each other, still alive and well, and living in Stockholm, presumably. The abortion was done because they felt they had too many children. There were no familial diseases in the history of either parent, and no history of cancer specifically in the families.”(2) 
 
The origin of the MCR-5 cell line, created in 1966, is documented in the journal Nature by three British researchers working at the National Institute for Medical Research. They wrote, “We have developed another strain of cells, also derived from foetal lung tissue, taken from a 14-week male foetus removed for psychiatric reasons from a 27 year old woman with a genetically normal family history and no sign of neoplastic disease both at abortion and for at least three years afterward.”(3) Noting that their research parallels that of Dr. Hayflick’s, the researchers conclude, “Our studies indicate that by presently accepted criteria, MRC-5 cells—in common with WI-38 cells of similar origin—have normal characteristics and so could be used for the same purposes as WI-38 cells.”(4) 
 
In both of these cell lines it is quite clear that the aborted children were presumed to be healthy, and that there was no life-threatening condition or other medically-indicated reason for the abortion of these two babies. 
 
A more recent cell line, PER.C6, developed in 1985, is also being used in vaccine production. The fetal cell line origin of PER.C6 is clearly documented. In direct testimony before the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, Dr. Alex Van Der Eb, the scientist who developed PER.C6, stated: 
 
“So I isolated retina [cells] from a fetus, from a healthy fetus as far as could be seen, of 18 weeks old. There was nothing special in the family history, or the pregnancy was completely normal up to the 18 weeks, and it turned out to be a socially indicated abortus, abortus provocatus, and that was simply because the woman wanted to get rid of the fetus.”(5) 
 
Dr. Alex Van Der Eb was also responsible for development of the HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line, which is widely used in vaccine and other medical research. He stated: 
“The kidney of the fetus was, with an unknown family history, was obtained in 1972 probably. The precise date is not known anymore. The fetus, as far as I can remember was completely normal. Nothing was wrong.”","2023-01-06 06:34:44","1893272097","2023-01-06","06:34:44"
"5279","DISEASES CAUSED BY MODERN VACCINE INGREDIENTS
We’ve seen the diseases caused by vaccines when their ingredients were
diseases from animals—mainly pus and pox. The diseases caused by
modern vaccine ingredients are also extensive. These diseases are the side effects of many vaccines, and are listed on the product inserts provided by the drug companies. These product inserts are usually 10 to 30 pages long, and not the one page printout pharmacies and doctors provide when you ask. Furthermore, these diseases, even death, are corroborated by millions of parents who’ve reported their experiences with vaccines. They’re listed on the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) database.
