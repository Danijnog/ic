"5075","Do some vaccines contain animal products? 
       Yes. Some vaccines contain weakened viruses, which can grow only in animal cells. The animal cells are used as a medium to grow the vaccine virus, which is then purified before being packaged as a vaccine. Purification takes place outside of the animal cell, but there may be very small amounts of animal protein or DNA in vaccines. 
       Gelatin, an animal product that is made from the skin or hooves of pigs, is also present in some vaccines. Gelatin is used as a stabilizing agent in some live virus vaccines (varicella, zoster, live attenuated influenza, and rabies), which may contain a sizable amount of it. This is an important consideration for those with severe allergy to gelatinâ€” a very rare allergy (one case per 1 million doses) but still the most commonly 
identified cause of a severe allergy to vaccines. The presence of gelatin may also raise concerns for certain religious groups that have dietary restrictions regarding the ingestion of pig products. On this matter, religious leaders from most denominations have sanctioned the receipt of gelatin- containing vaccines because vaccination does not involve ingestion, and the modified gelatin used in vaccines is substantially different than natural gelatin.

""Vaccination programs were instituted in the late 1930s, and the first handful of autistic babies were noted in the early 1940s. When vaccination programs were expanded after the war, the number of autistic children increased greatly.""---Harris Coulter Ph.D. 
 
Vijendra Singh, PhD 
""In 1993 Vijendra Singh, PhD University of Illinois, published a study in which they found antibodies to myelin basic protein in 50 to 60% of autistic children tested. Recently at a public meeting Dr. Singh presented information on an unpublished, preliminary study of 27 autistic children in which he found nearly 50% correlation between MMR antibodies and antibodies to myelin basic protein in serum drawn from the children.   Dr. Singh emphasized that this study was very preliminary and that no conclusions could be drawn from it. However, it does raise a higher index of suspicion that the MMR vaccine may result in encephalitis and its various complications on a fairly large scale.""---Harold Buttram, MD 
 
""Dr. Singh reported his own anecdotal survey of apparently vaccine-injured children with regressive autism. He found that 93% of cases had autistic symptoms shortly after vaccinations. Of these, 52% were post-MMR, 8% post MMR and DPT, and 33% post-DPT. Just 7% were not linked by the parents to any vaccination. He acknowledged that the survey was non-scientific.""--David Thrower 
 
""V. Singh,MDM, a specialist from Utah State who has studied over 400 cases of autism, found that these children had experienced an autoimmune episode, in which their own bodies had been made to attack the linings of their nervous systems. Dr. Singh characterized the epidemic as a ""hyperimmune response to the measles virus."" He stated that 55% of the families said that autism appeared soon after an MMR shot, and that 33% of families said it appeared soon after a DPT shot. Such neurologic damage is a well-established side-effect of the mercury, aluminum, and formaldehyde used in these vaccines.""---Tim O'Shea, DC 
 
John O'Leary, PhD 
""John O'Leary, PhD, a world-class researcher and molecular biologist from Ireland, using state-of-the-art sequencing technology, showed how he had found the measles virus in the gut of 96% of autistic children, compared to 6.6% in normal children. This virus did not come from the natural disease, but from the measles vaccine. Dr. O'Leary found measles virus present in 75% of children with Crohn's disease. Crohn's has traditionally been an intestinal disease of adults, following years of dietary abuse. Its appearance in children is a new event, and Dr. O'Leary's work points to the measles virus from vaccines as the likely cause.""---Tim O'Shea, DC 
 
Mary N. Megson, M.D., F.A.A.P 
""Autism may be a disorder linked to the disruption of the G-alpha protein, affecting retinoid receptors in the brain. A study of sixty autistic children suggests that autism may be caused by inserting a G-alpha protein defect, the pertussis toxin found in the D.P.T. vaccine, into genetically at-risk children.""---Mary N.
