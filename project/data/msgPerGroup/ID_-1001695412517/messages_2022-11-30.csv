"12427","Google gave FBI location data for thousands of cell phones near Jan. 6 riots, court records show

Filings in the case against suspect David Rhine show Google identified 5,723 devices as being in or near the building, Wired reported. Google in May 2021 provided names, details, and maps for 1,535 devices to the FBI. The warrants for user data are sealed, but an effort by Rhine's attorney to throw out location data showed the extent of the information sharing. Google's sharing of cellphone information is the tech giant's largest-ever disclosure of geolocation data to law enforcement agencies. Some legal experts warn the move is a dangerous precedent for civil liberties. American University law professor Andrew Ferguson told Wired: ""The January 6 cases are going to be used to build a doctrine that will essentially enable police to find almost anyone with a cellphone or a smart device in ways that we, as a society, haven't quite grasped yet."" He added that the move could expose journalists and political dissenters to government surveillance.

"12409","100 Million Dead Birds Are Just the Beginning, Because This Pestilence Is Far From Over

Did you know that an extremely vicious virus that is currently sweeping across the globe has already killed more than 100 million birds?  If you haven’t heard about this yet, don’t feel bad, because most people in the general population don’t know about this either.  Like so many of the other nightmares that we are facing right now, the mainstream media continues to downplay the bird flu crisis and continues to insist that authorities have everything under control.  But of course the truth is that they don’t have this outbreak under control.  Flocks are being steadily wiped out all over the planet, and prices for turkey, chicken and eggs just keep going higher and higher.  If the bird flu spreads even faster in 2023 than it did in 2022, it won’t be too long before we have some pretty serious shortages on our hands.

Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, it was being reported that the official death toll in the U.S. has now reached 50.54 million.  That makes this “the worst animal-health disaster in U.S. history”…

----------------------
More than 50.54 million U.S. birds have died in what is the worst Avian flu outbreak in U.S. history, according to data from the Department of Agriculture, Reuters reports. It also marks the worst animal-health disaster in U.S. history.
----------------------

But it is perfectly “normal” for tens of millions of our turkeys and chickens to be wiped out, right?

Unfortunately, this pestilence is not just limited to the United States.  In fact, the UK and the European Union “are also suffering their worst avian-flu crises”…

----------------------
Losses of poultry flocks sent prices for eggs and turkey meat to record highs, worsening economic pain for consumers facing red-hot inflation and making Thursday’s Thanksgiving celebrations more expensive in the United States. Europe and Britain are also suffering their worst avian-flu crises, and some British supermarkets rationed customers’ egg purchases after the outbreak disrupted supplies.
----------------------

We have never seen anything like this before.

According to CNBC, the number of dead birds in the EU alone has reached “nearly 50 million”…

----------------------

Governments across Europe have culled bird populations to limit the spread of avian flu. Almost six million birds have been killed in the Netherlands since October 2021, while Spain, Bulgaria, Denmark and France have also been badly affected.

Nearly 50 million birds have been killed in Europe this year as countries try to contain the disease, according to the EU’s Food Safety Agency.

----------------------

Actually, that figure is a bit old, but I was not able to find an updated one.

But if you take that number and add 50 million from the United States, that gives us a grand total of approximately 100 million dead birds, and that doesn’t even account for the remainder of the globe.

For example, nearly 3 million birds have already been wiped out in Japan, and at this point the bird flu is beginning to spread like wildfire in that country…

----------------------

Cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, are spreading at an unusual pace in Japan, with 18 outbreaks confirmed this season through Saturday at poultry farms in 12 of the country’s 47 prefectures.

But that number is expected to rise further, in line with global trends.

----------------------

This has truly become a worldwide crisis.

Past outbreaks have either greatly subsided or completely gone away during the hot summer months, but that did not happen this year.

In 2022, the virus “continued to fester” during the warmer months, and now authorities are concerned that things could get much worse during the cold months that are in front of us…

"12412","2 Million Migrants Set to Become Citizens Overnight as Germany Doubles Down on Great Replacement

Germany is inching closer to a major overhaul of citizenship and immigration laws that could see 2 million immigrants become citizens overnight, with Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and Chancellor Olaf Scholz, both of the Social Democrats (SPD), driving forward with their plan even as the country deals with a crisis that has seen 1.2 million migrants arrive just in 2022.

The new law features a number of radical changes that will shape Germany’s demographic and political future for generations.

The changes, listed below, are already being decried by not only conservatives, but also the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), which is a coalition partner in the left-wing government. Junge Freiheit columnist Michael Paulwitz writes about the proposed changes: “The citizenship certificate, a document that should be among the most desirable and hardest to obtain in the world, becomes an effortless junk item in Germany’s ‘going out of business’ sale.”

He continues by writing that “the Federal Minister of the Interior is planning nothing more and nothing less than a coup from above against the sovereign of the German Basic Law, the state’s people. The composition (of Germany’s population) will be radically transformed and in fact replaced by a randomly mixed-up population. Of course, nobody asked the people about this, just like with all other previous substantive changes.”

Less time to become a citizen

Currently, foreigners must live in Germany for eight years to obtain citizenship in most cases, but the new law would reduce this to five to become naturalized. In exceptional cases, the new law would allow migrants to receive citizenship in just three years for those who show sufficient language skills and professional or academic achievement.

The immediate result of this new law would be approximately 2 million migrants, many of them Syrians along with other Middle Easterners and Africans who arrived in 2015 and 2016, obtaining citizenship overnight along with their children.

Automatic citizenship for children

The Federal Ministry of the Interior also plans for children of migrants to automatically receive German citizenship if one parent has had their “lawful habitual residence” in Germany for five years.

Dual citizenship

The reform would also mean an end to the obligation requiring German citizens to renounce their other citizenship. As a result, Germany will begin a new regime of dual citizenship.

Easier language requirement for seniors

For migrants aged 67 years and older, language requirements will be “simplified,” and they will no longer have to take a written test to prove sufficient language ability; instead, they will only have to prove their “ability to communicate orally.”

Even more shocking is that for those who are illiterate, there will be a “hardship regulation,” which means no tests at all will be required in order to obtain German citizenship.

No more German cultural requirements

In addition, a “classification” of the migrants’ assimilation “into German living customs” is no longer required, Bild newspaper reports. In other words, Germany is abandoning the idea that migrants have to integrate with German society. Authorities previously checked whether applicants for a German passport were possibly married to several wives at the same time.

Germany has seen a rapid increase in child brides, and as many as 60,000 women are threatened by female genital mutilation, which the German government asserts is entirely due to the country’s massively growing immigrant population from Africa and the Middle East.

An internal report from the SPD parliamentary group states that the new law will reach the cabinet by Christmas

"12418","Hoje aconteceu algo insesperado

Hoje aconteceu algo inusitado: eu estava em casa a jogar Minecraft e gritar insultos raciais quando de repente sinto uma comichão desconhecida nos testículos por isso levanto as calças para ver e grito em choque quando descubro uma miniatura do António Costa a fazer planos maléficos e esfregar as mãos maliciosamente, eu tento afugentar a criatura com uma faca mas falho e acerto no meu saco (causando dores consideráveis) porque ele é muito esquivo e matreiro devido às suas características de político. Assim que começo a aceitar a minha derrota iminente contra o magano ele agarra-se aos meus pelos genitais e começa-me a controlar tipo o bicho do Ratatouille e de repente sinto uma vontade insaciável de ser dominado por uma mulher diabólica e perversa. Imediatamente, tiro a roupa toda e corro o mais depressa que posso pela rua até chegar áquele fatídico prédio... o infame bordel socialista. Sou agarrado por dois cavalheiros vestidos de coelho e sou arrastado para uma sala especial, e é aí que me encontro com uma criatura vista apenas em mitos urbanos, era ela... a Catarina Martins. Ela olha para mim com um olhar luxuriante e diz ""bem bem bem o que é que o camarada António me trouxe hoje"" e subitamente sou levitado até ela que destapa o seio esquerdo e me obriga a chupar-lhe o mamilo enquanto uma segunda cabeça de Marisa Matias lhe surge da vagina e engole violentamente o meu pénis fazendo-o ejacular várias vezes. Apesar do meu corpo estar a apreciar a visita, a minha consciência sabia que este ato era errado e já estava a pensar que esta aventura não teria fim, mas é aí que aparece o amor da minha vida e minha segunda metade, André Ventura (o André tem a pele negra, cabelo grosso, olhos azuis de morrer e uns abdominais irresistíveis; para não esquecer o seu magnífico pénis) que confronta as injustiças e o socialismo na cara e não tem medo de nada. Ele ajoelha-se no chão e faz três vénias a Alá, e de repente a infame criatura guincha e foge instantaneamente; soltando a minha boca do seu mamilo esquerdo. No entanto, ainda restava a pequena criatura na minha genitália mas segundo o André eu posso ser salvo se beber três litros do esperma dele (o que eu não me importo nada de fazer) e assim o faço. O meu herói sussurra no meu ouvido que agora estou seguro e leva-me para casa e tudo está bem quando acaba bem
