The most ironic thing I've found in Fomenko's New Chronology is: Isaac Assimov's Foundation is set in 10,000 CE but it reads like a blueprint for UN Agenda 22, Agenda for the 22nd Century, only the plan would be to invent the new calendar and add a few thousand years like the last time civilization collapsed, seeing that 2022 CE already counts as 869 AD and 7530 Slavic Aryan Vedic Calendar.","2022-11-09 01:47:57","1552113836","2022-11-09","01:47:57"
"4997","The ""mystery"" of this silencing by the press of such vital facts is explained by the Hon. W. Jennings Bryan, who said :  
""Newspapers do not give facts, they fool the people regularly.""-(New York Times, May 16, 1921).   
""American! know nothing about what is going on overseas (Shaw Desmond,  The Chicago Tribune, March 1, 1924).

""Europe is descending towards dissolution, We are willing to check  the descent. But we are unable to determine, how we can help. We are not  well informed as to the facts! The danger of complete collapse is nearer than  ever"" (""Chicago Tribune,"" Febr. 7, 1923), .  
The newspapers have hundreds of informers, but they remain  silent. 
Why? Because the press is controlled by the ""sons of the devil""!

demanded that ""History be rewritten and revised,"" thus to expose  ""the organizers of all wars."" On the contrary, when Mr. Henry  Ford placed incontrovertible facts, bearing on the causes of the  World unrest, before the public, newspapers generally trampled  upon his words and endeavored to discredit him.

czar (n.)

the common title of the emperor of Russia, 1550s, from Russian tsar, from Old Slavic tsesari, from Gothic kaisar, from Greek kaisar, from Latin Caesar. First adopted by Russian emperor Ivan IV, 1547.

    The spelling with cz- is against the usage of all Slavonic languages; the word was so spelt by Herberstein, Rerum Moscovit. Commentarii, 1549, the chief early source of knowledge as to Russia in Western Europe, whence it passed into the Western Languages generally; in some of these it is now old-fashioned; the usual Ger. form is now zar; French adopted tsar during the 19th c. This also became frequent in English towards the end of that century, having been adopted by the Times newspaper as the most suitable English spelling. [OED]

The Germanic form of the word also is the source of Finnish keisari, Estonian keisar. The transferred sense of ""person with dictatorial powers"" is first recorded 1866, American English, initially in reference to President Andrew Johnson. The fem. czarina is 1717, from Italian czarina, from Ger. Zarin, fem. of Zar ""czar."" The Russian fem. form is tsaritsa. His son is tsarevitch, his daughter is tsarevna.

Caesar 

""an emperor, a ruler, a dictator,"" late 14c., cesar, from Cæsar, originally a surname of the Julian gens in Rome, elevated to a title after Caius Julius Caesar (100 B.C.E.-44 B.C.E.) became dictator; it was used as a title of emperors down to Hadrian (138 C.E.). The name is of uncertain origin; Pliny derives it from caesaries ""head of hair,"" because the future dictator was born with a full one; Century Dictionary suggests Latin caesius ""bluish-gray"" (of the eyes), also used as a proper name. Also compare caesarian.

Old English had casere, which would have yielded modern *coser, but it was replaced in Middle English by keiser (c. 1200), from Norse or Low German, and later by the French or Latin form of the name. Cæsar also is the root of German Kaiser and Russian tsar (see czar). He competes as progenitor of words for ""king"" with Charlemagne (Latin Carolus), as in Lithuanian karalius, Polish krol.

The use in reference to ""temporal power as the object of obedience"" (contrasted with God) is from Matthew xxii.21. Caesar's wife (1570s) as the figure of a person who should be above suspicion is from Plutarch. In U.S. slang c. 1900, a sheriff was Great Seizer.

tsar (n.)

1660s, the more correct Latinization of Russian czar, from prehistoric Slavic *tsesar, from a Germanic source, ultimately from Latin Caesar. See czar. Related: Tsardom; tsarevich; tsarina; tsarevna.

caesarian (n.)

""delivery of a child by cutting through the abdomen of the mother,"" 1923, shortening of Caesarian section (1610s); caesar as ""baby delivered by caesarian section is from 1530s. Section (n.) here has the literal Latin sense of ""act or action of cutting,"" attested from 1550s but outside of medicine rare in English.

Supposedly from Caius Julius Caesar, who was said to have been delivered surgically, thus legend traces his cognomen to Latin caesus, past participle of caedere ""to cut"" (see -cide). But if this is the etymology of the name, it was likely an ancestor who was so born (Caesar's mother lived to see his triumphs and such operations would have been fatal to the woman in ancient times). Rather, caesar here may come directly from caesus.

The operation was prescribed in Rome for cases of dead mothers; the first recorded instance of it being performed on a living woman is c. 1500, but as late as the early 19c., before antiseptics and blood transfusions, it had a 50% mortality rate.
