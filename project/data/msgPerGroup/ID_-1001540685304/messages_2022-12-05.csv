panics for profit, such as the ones in the Kansas City in 1921, Pittsburgh 
in 1924, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington in 1925. An effort was also 
made to create a panic in New York in 1925, but due to the open fight 
against it by the New York Evening Graphic, the Commissioner of Health 
called it off.”—Dr. Herbert Shelton (1895-1985), DC","2022-12-05 00:52:30","1623367056","2022-12-05","00:52:30"

"5123","Live Capture of Primates 
     Primates have routinely been captured alive for export (the international trade to supply zoos and for biomedical research and pharmaceutical testing) or to serve local pet trades. The height of the international primate 
trade began at the end of the 1950s and continued through the early 1960s, during which time hundreds of thousands of monkeys were taken from the wild each year (Mack and Mittermeier, 1984). The trade consisted 
largely of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) exported from India and used in laboratory tests as part of the effort to develop a vaccine for polio and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) imported by the United States 
from several Amazonian countries. Subsequently, the imposition of export bans by habitat countries, import restrictions by user countries, and a decreased demand from biomedical research and zoological parks contributed to a significant decline in the international traffic in primates. 
     In 1982, in recognition of the serious effect that live capture for export can have on wild primate populations, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)/ Species Survival 
Commission (SSC) Primate Specialist Group prepared a Policy Statement on the Use of Primates for Biomedical Purposes, which includes the recommendation that endangered, vulnerable, or rare species be considered for use in biomedical research projects only if they are obtained from existing, self-sustaining captive breeding colonies. This policy statement was subsequently adopted by the World Health Organization and the Ecosystem Conservation Group of the United Nations, which includes UNESCO, the Food and Agricultural 
Organization (FAO), UNEP, and IUCN. It is still valid today.  TEXT COPY AND PASTE FROM: Encyclopedia of biodiversity","2022-12-05 16:15:21","1623367056","2022-12-05","16:15:21"
