Many hackers around the world are (re-)decentralizing the net. This is our part, offering distributed, free (as in freedom) services to the world. Always based on Free Open Source Software.

We believe that building, owning and controlling technology is important. Hackers and Open Source communities have an opportunity and a responsibility to offer an alternative, to offer services and tools that people can trust. Beyond corporate control, that comes with tracking and data farming. Decentralized services and tools that respect users privacy by default.","2022-12-26 11:35:49","49490074","2022-12-26","11:35:49"
