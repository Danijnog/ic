Another cheap harbinger of the New World Order, McKay worked for the Herst Syndicate and romanticized living in fantastic and scary dreams, discouraged lucid and wakeful perception.
He could draw quick, whatever his puppet masters told him to draw. All his creative drive was bent on scheming for the new world order, from Rare Bit Fiends, comic strips about nightmares from eating bread and cheese cooked in beer and named after the pagan hare goddess, rare bit or rabbit, all the way to the sinking of the Lusitania, another New World Order false flag operation fomenting and inciting war like 9/11, Gulf of Tonkin, and Pearl Harbor, all orchestrated if not outright staged by the US government. The German embassy was censored from NYC newspapers, placed giant advertisements warning travelers not to take passage on the Lusitania because it would be bringing weapons through waters in dispute by the war, and none of those advertisements was printed; decades later, the Lusitania was dredged and indeed there were weapons in the hold. The Hearst Syndicate both blocked German warnings AND promoted McKay's animation of the false narrative, beyond yellow journalism and into espionage and treason, deceiving the American people and Congress to war!
A modern examples of a cartoonist similar to McKay's political leanings would be Ernie Colon, a career cartoonist for Marvel/Disney who illustrated an entire graphic novel portraying the government's false narrative on 9/11.","2022-11-15 23:59:18","1552113836","2022-11-15","23:59:18"
