Abstract 
Thimerosal, a derivative of mercury, is used as a preservative in hepatitis B vaccines. We measured total mercury levels before and after the administration of this vaccine in 15 preterm and 5 term infants. Comparison of pre- and post-vaccination mercury levels showed a significant increase in both preterm and term infants after vaccination. Additionally, post-vaccination mercury levels were significantly higher in preterm infants as compared with term infants. Because mercury is known to be a potential neurotoxin to infants, further study of its pharmacodynamics is warranted.","2022-12-07 17:15:03","1893272097","2022-12-07","17:15:03"

"5134","The various vaccines given to children, as well 
as adults, may contain either whole weakened 
infectious agents or synthetic peptides and genetically 
engineered antigens of infectious agents and 
adjuvants (typically aluminum). In addition, they 
also contain diluents, preservatives (thimerosal, 
formaldehyde), detergents (polysorbate), and 
residuals of culture growth media (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, gelatin, bovine extract, monkey kidney 
tissue, etc.; Table I.2). The safety of these residuals 
has not been thoroughly investigated, primarily 
because they are presumed to be present only in 
trace amounts following the vaccine manufacture 
purification process. However, some studies 
suggest that even these trace amounts may not 
be inherently safe, as was previously assumed 
(Moghaddam et al., 2006; Rinaldi et al., 2013). 
What is obvious, nonetheless, is that a typical 
vaccine formulation contains all the necessary 
biochemical components to induce autoimmune 
manifestations. With that in mind, our major aim 
is to inform the medical community regarding 
the various autoimmune risks associated with 
different vaccines. Physicians need to be aware 
that in certain individuals, vaccinations can trigger 
serious and potentially disabling and even fatal 
autoimmune manifestations. This is not to say that 
we oppose vaccination, as it is indeed an important 
tool of preventative medicine. However, given the 
fact that vaccines are predominantly administered 
to previously healthy individuals, efforts should 
be made to identify those subjects who may be 
at more risk of developing adverse autoimmune 
events following vaccine exposure. In addition, 
careful assessment should be made regarding 
further vaccine administration in individuals 
with previous histories of adverse reactions to 
vaccinations. The necessity of multiple vaccinations 
over a short period of time should also 
be considered, as the enhanced adjuvant-like 
effect of multiple vaccinations heightens the risk 
of post-vaccine-associated adverse autoimmune 
and inflammatory manifestations (Tsumiyama 
et al., 2009; Lujan et al., 2013).","2022-12-07 18:42:40","1893272097","2022-12-07","18:42:40"
