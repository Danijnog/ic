"16271","With our tacit consent.

 The recent story with Balenciaga clearly demonstrated the power of human dissent.  Notice how people didn't have to stand up and demand the end of the pedo brand.  It turned out to be a critical mass (and not even that big) of votes that said “NO” in unison.
 Yes, banning perverts from fashion to promote violence against children is certainly easier than forbidding perverts from politics to take away rights and freedoms.  But that doesn't mean that nothing can be done about it.
 Covid rebuff was long in coming.  And even now it cannot be said that it has reached the necessary strength and scale.  But today's efforts of covidobes from the government still cannot be compared with the powerful pressure that we all experienced at the end of 2021.
 Now we are being shoved down the throat at the same time an energy crisis with a warming climate and, as it were, logical restrictions aimed at even greater restrictions on rights and freedoms: restriction of freedom of movement, restriction of consumption, restriction of the ability to use a car, even an electric one ...
 And again, as with covid, a critical mass of voices will be enough to say a firm “no” to this whole story.
 For this, it is probably necessary that more people become aware that all climate policy is not aimed at saving the planet, but at increasing the incomes of elites and restricting the rights and freedoms of everyone else.
 It is clear that, as in the case of covidobes who knew for sure someone who, they were told, died of covid (regardless of the real cause of death of the unfortunate person).  So in the climate situation, any eco-activist or sympathizer knows for sure that people are polluting the planet, and that people are overusing resources.  And you can't argue with that.  So to act here on the principle of covid online battles with the mutual sending of links to ""authoritative sources"" seems to me as ineffective as it was with covid.
 Maybe an open-ended strategy would be more persuasive.
 What questions can be asked to those who do not mind that “we all need to make efforts together to save the planet” (with a high probability, these are the same superheroes who, until recently, put on muzzles and saved grandmothers)?
 Ask them, for example, why do they think governments around the world are actively taxing private cars but refusing to tax private yachts and planes even though their emissions are dozens of times greater than cars?
 Ask them how CO2 affects air temperature and ask for a link to an authoritative source.  Perhaps those who really try to find this information will find to their surprise that the temperature level has always affected the level of CO2 in the air, but the level of CO2 has never had any effect on changes in air temperature.
 Ask them how mass production of electric cars will save the planet's resources?  And ask for justification.
 Help start thinking for those who are just used to considering themselves a thinking person.  Then, perhaps, we will have time to add voices to our chorus of dissent, and we will be able to stop another raid to seize our rights and freedoms.
 Because all this shit is introduced and becomes possible only with our tacit consent.","2022-12-07 06:54:13","1220559767","2022-12-07","06:54:13"

"16279","The Tesla Phone smartphone 
 
In the back of the phone there is a solar panel, which allows for 30 minutes of stay under the sun to charge the device at 20%. So, for example, being in a trip away from civilization, not being able to charge your phone, you can always be in touch, just putting the phone under the sunlight. None of the existing flagships can boast such a feature. 
 
The Tesla Phone also has the ability to connect directly to Starlink and use high-speed satellite Internet from anywhere in the world. At the same time for buyers of smartphones this network will be available for free and without time limits.
